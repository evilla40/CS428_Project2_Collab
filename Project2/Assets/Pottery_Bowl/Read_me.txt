Ciao!

Happy to see you're trying out one of my models.

The setup is simple. There are two texture folders, one is for UE4 and the other is for 
Unity.

The UE4 folder has 3 textures, Albedo/Normal/Metallic, Roughness, AO.
The Metallic, Roughness, and AO are connected via Blue, Green, Red in that order.

The Unity folder has 4 textures, Albedo/Normal/Metallic, Smoothness/AO

Hope you guys enjoy it. If you have any questions, please contact me via the marketplace pm 
and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
